Day-1
*****
	JavaScript is Scripting Language.

	we can execute JavaScript in two ways.

		1) Intrepreter

		2) node tool

	Intrepreter present in Browsers.

		Ex.
			Google Chrome

			Firefox

			Netscape

			Opera

	node tool present in "NodeJS"

	we will save the JavaScript files with ".js" extension

	we will include javascript to the webpages by using <script> tag.

	by default javascript execution is Synchronous.
	
	JavaScript Released by Netscape.

	Current Version of JavaScript is ES13

	ES Stands for ECMA Script.

	JavaScript, used to build the Angular,React,Node,VueJS,......

	JavaScript wont follows the OOPS.

	Visual Studio Code is Suggestable IDE to build the JavaScript Applications.

	Visual Studio Code also called as "VSCode".

	"VSCode" IDE Released by Microsoft and Open Source IDE.	

	Vendor Provided predefined Objects

		Ex.
			console
			
			window

			document

			---
			---
			---

	JavaScript we can call Object Based Scripting Language.

	Superset of JavaScript called as TypeScript.

	TypeScript Relesed by Microsoft.

Installation of Softwares
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) download and install NodeJS

	"node" is the tool, used to execute the JavaScript

website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

file    : node-v16.13.0-x64.msi



2) download and install Visual Studio Code

website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.62.1.exe


Execution of JavaScript
+++++++++++++++++++++++

> node demo.js


Variables
*********
	variables are used to store the data

	Ex.
			string

			number

			boolean

			arrays

			Objects

	we will declare variables by using "var", "let" and "const" keyword.

	"let" and "const" keywords introduced in ES6.

	ES Stands for ECMA Script.

	variables should contain a-z , A-Z , 0-9, $ and _

	variables should not start with digits.

	Syntax
	******
	var / let / const variablename = value;

	Ex.
		var msg = "welcome to angular13";

TypeScript
**********
	TypeScript is the "Programming" Language.

	TypeScript Released by "Microsoft".

	TypeScript is the "Programming" Language.

	TypeScript follows the OOPS.

		Ex.
			inheritance

			polymorphsim

			encapsulation

			abstraction

	TypeScript used to build the Angular,React,Node,VueJS,.......

	we will save the TypeScript files with ".ts" extension

	Visual Studio Code is Suggestable IDE to Build the TypeScript Applications

	Visual Studio Code also called as "VSCode"

	VSCode IDE Given by "Microsoft" and open "source" IDE.

	In General, browsers won't understand TypeScript.

	So, we need to convert TypeScript to Equalent JavaScript.

	conversion of TypeScript to Equalent javascript called as Transpilation

	"tsc" is the tool, used to perform the Transpilation.

	"tsc" stands for TypeScript Compiler.


Software Installation
*********************

	> npm install -g typescript


	- npm stands for "node packaging manager"

	- npm present in "NodeJS"

	- "-g" stands for "global Installation"


Transpilation
*************

	> tsc demo.ts
		o/p

	demo.js

	> node demo.js


variables
*********
	variables are used to store the data

	ex.
		string, number, boolean, objects, arrays,........


	variables we will declare with the help of "var", "let" or "const" keyword

	let and const keywords introduced in "ES6" / "ES2015"

	variables should contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9, $ and _

	variables should not start with "digits"

Syntax
******
	let variablename:datatype = value;

Ex.
	let msg:string = "welcome to typescript";
	console.log(msg);
